Republican Dan Bishop defeated Democrat Dan McCready in Tuesday’s special election for a North Carolina U.S. House seat, holding onto the seat for the GOP after 2018’s vote was thrown out for fraud and giving President Trump a victory, although a worryingly narrow one.

The White House offered full-throated support for Bishop, with Trump and Vice President Pence both traveling to the state Monday night in a final push to win the Ninth District seat. Trump won the district by 12 points in 2016, but there were concerns that the president’s flagging popularity in the suburbs could hurt Bishop. Polling had shown a tight race and millions poured into the state, making it one of the most expensive House races in history.
